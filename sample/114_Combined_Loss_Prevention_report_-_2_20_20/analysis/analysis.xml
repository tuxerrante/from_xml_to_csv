Generator Protection: General Electric supplied the generator relay protection package; a SEL protection package is provided for backup.
Maintenance: Generator maintenance has been limited. In 2016 the epoxy modification was completed on Units 2 and 3. In
October 2017 Cogentrix performed electrical testing on all four units (stator – Megger, PI, Power Factor and winding Resistance,
Field – Megger, PI, Impedance) and the RTD’s were tested. All test reports were satisfactory.
Hydrogen: Hydrogen purity is maintained by bleed and replenish. The generators have hydrogen dryers, but they are not in service.
Generator liquid detectors are functionally tested on six-month intervals.

17. Loss Estimates
(All Values in US Currency)
PROPERTY DAMAGE: $278,554,442
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION: (12 MONTHS) $38,400,000
TOTAL P.D. &amp; B.I.: $316,954,412
FIRE LOSS ESTIMATES
ANTICIPATED PROBABLE LOSS:
P.D. $4,400,000 B.I. $1,600,000 Total $6,000,200
The Anticipated Probable Loss estimate assumes all fire protection systems work as designed and emergency response personnel (both site PEO and public agencies) act in accordance with existing plans. Under these circumstances, the worst-case loss would involve a fire inside one of the combustion turbine enclosures fed by a leak in the lubricating oil supply piping or natural gas. The fire would be controlled and limited by the CO2 system. Fire damaged parts would need to be replaced, and the combustion turbine generator would need to be pulled apart so the rotor could be examined for possible loss of strength and material embrittlement. P.D. is estimated at 10% of the estimated $43,600,000 replacement cost of approximately $4,400,000.
BI would be estimated as 60 days until repairs and inspections could be performed. The facility would remain in operation with the remaining three units.
BI is calculated as:
$38,400,000 /12 months/4units = $800,000 per month (rounded)
1 unit x 2 months = $1,600,000
PROBABLE MAXIMUM LOSS:
P.D. $46,600,000 B.I. $9,600,000 Total $56,200,000
The Probable Maximum Loss estimate assumes a single fire protection system is out of service at the time of the incident and emergency response personnel (both site PEO and public agencies) act in accordance with existing plans, given potentially delayed notification due to the failure of the fire protection system. Under these circumstances, the worst case loss would involve a major fire in a combustion turbine generator which would most likely be a lubricating oil supply fire. Therefore, the fire would get out of control resulting in destruction of the combustion turbine with some periphery damage to surrounding equipment.
Separation distance is adequate to prevent the fire spread to any other units. Fire department response is not considered except for exposure protection due to the potential for an explosion in the combustion turbine.
The PD loss is estimated at $ 43,600,000 for rebuild of one combustion turbine and another $3,000,000 for periphery damage to surrounding equipment for a total PD estimate of $46,600,000.
It is estimated to take 12 months to replace the combustion turbine generator, as extended repairs would be required as the above scenario would also take out the mechanical package of the combustion turbine. During the 12 months, 25% of production would be lost, resulting in an estimated BI loss of $9,600,000.

Harbert Management Corp. – Washington County Power #1725.0005
Sandersville/Georgia/USA 02/20
MAXIMUM FORESEEABLE LOSS:
P.D. $46,600,000 B.I. $9,600,000 Total $56,200,000
The Maximum Foreseeable Loss estimate assumes complete failure of all active fire suppression systems and ineffective response from the site PEO and public agencies. Under these circumstances, the worst-case loss would involve the same scenario as the PML due to good spatial separation.
MAXIMUM FORESEEABLE LOSS – 100 YEAR FLOOD / EARTHQUAKE EXPOSURE:
Flood Estimate: $0 Earthquake Estimate: $0
Flood: The site is in an area of minimal flood exposure and no flood loss would be expected.
Earthquake: The site is in an area of low seismic risk and no earthquake loss would be expected.
BOILER MACHINERY LOSS ESTIMATES
PROBABLE MAXIMUM LOSS
P.D. $15,000,000 B.I. $4,800,000 Total 19,800,000
The Probable Maximum Loss (PML) represents the maximum amount of sudden or accidental loss to an object that is likely to occur.
The event chosen would be the failure of an R-0 compressor blade resulting in significant damage to the compressor stationary and rotating blades.
The Business Interruption value would be (0.50 year) ($38,400,000) (25%) or approximately $4,800,000.
MAXIMUM FORESEEABLE LOSS
P.D. $43,602,000 B.I. $9,600,000 Total $53,202,000
The Maximum Foreseeable Loss (MFL) is based on the maximum amount of sudden or accidental loss that can occur to an object without any credit to spare equipment or any expediting efforts which might reduce the loss.
The event chosen would be an overspeed event of the turbine resulting in the destruction of the turbine and generator. The damage would require the unit to be replaced.
The Business Interruption value would be (12/12) ($38,400,000) (25%) or approximately $9,600,000.
