This is a fire protection and property loss prevention consulting report, resulting from the Starr
Technical Risks Agency, Inc.’s (Starr Tech) annual site survey of this combined-cycle power generation facility. The plant consists of a combustion turbine-generator unit, a steam turbine- generator unit, a control building and associated equipment.
The evaluation and recommendations presented are made in accordance with applicable National Fire
Protection Association (NFPA) standards, including the 2015 edition of NFPA 850, Fire Protection for
Electric Generating Plants, the 2018 edition of NFPA 12, Carbon Dioxide Fire Extinguishing Systems, and best industry practices. Fixed fire protection is provided for all significant equipment and buildings.
The water supply is from a public source. Human element loss prevention programs are established.
The level of protection is generally very good.
This report contains two findings with one previous identified opportunity for risk reduction and one new recommendation. A list containing several informal maintenance recommendations is submitted directly to local plant management. The items on this list comprise minor deficiencies or other suggested improvements that can be corrected with little or no cost.
This plant is very well managed and maintained. The client has consistently demonstrated a strong interest in loss prevention and goal to achieve and maintain a superior level of fire prevention and protection. This is evident through a history of considering and completing recommendations in a prompt manner.
This survey included a visual inspection of the facilities, meetings and discussions with plant staff, review of relevant documents and fire flow tests.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The following Risk Improvement Recommendations are made in the interest of reducing loss by fire, explosion and allied perils. They have been developed based on national codes and standards, industry best practices, and/or sound loss control judgment. Recommendations are categorized in the following manner based on severity:
PRIORITY: Recommendations to correct conditions that are serious enough to affect the overall level of risk to the facility or that represent an immediate potential for property and/or business income loss. Completion of these recommendations will greatly improve the risk profile but also may require corporate support for capital expenditure. Starr Tech suggests that these items be given top priority in risk improvement planning and budgeting,
IMPORTANT: Recommendations to correct specific conditions to achieve and maintain a tolerable level of property protection. Completion of these items is warranted to improve existing loss control measures and to introduce fundamental loss control techniques.
ADVISORY: Recommendations to correct deficiencies that are maintenance in nature or that do not substantially affect the overall level of risk at the facility. These items typically address planning, procedural or record keeping issues as well as capital improvements that may not be economically justified at the present time.
Starr Tech suggests that implementation of any non-capital improvements be undertaken immediately and that systems for ongoing compliance be established.
It is requested that written response to all items be provided within 90 days of the receipt of this report.
PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
There are no recommendations under this category.
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS
P2019-01 Gas Turbine Carbon Dioxide System Revalidation
A full acceptance test was performed on the gas turbine’s total-flooding carbon dioxide (CO2) fire extinguishing system in 2005. Over time, conditions can deteriorate and negatively affect the CO2 system’s ability to adequately extinguish fire. These include deteriorated door seals, leaks in the enclosure and improper reassembly following major outages. The failure to achieve and maintain the minimum required concentration can result in a large fire loss.
In accordance with the recommendations of NFPA 850 and good practice, a full CO2 concentration test should be performed periodically to revalidate the system’s effectiveness. The minimum 37% concentration should be achieved in one minute and retained for 40 minutes, in accordance with the system’s original design. This test should be coordinated with Starr Tech so that a representative can witness the test.
Comments: This is a new recommendation. Mr. Hammett considers the upcoming major overhaul in
2020 as a good opportunity for this test. Starr Tech agrees.

RECOMMENDATIONS (Continued)
ADVISORY RECOMMENDATIONS
P2012-04 Fire Protection for Cooling Tower
The six-cell cooling tower is made of combustible fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials and plastic fill, as defined by NFPA 214, Water Cooling Towers. It is not provided with automatic sprinkler protection. The cooling tower affects 100% of power production and is thus essential to operations.
FRP tower manufacturers often make claims that towers are made of “fire retardant” materials and preclude the need for sprinkler protection based on the ASTM E-84 flame spread testing. This is incorrect because the E-84 rating does not duplicate the larger extent of the hazard in its final installation and is not intended to be used as a definition of combustibility of a material or overall fire risk. The loss of the tower in the event of fire results in a prolonged forced outage estimated at three to four months.
To reduce the risk of fire, an automatic sprinkler system should be provided for the cooling tower in accordance with the current editions of NFPA 214, and NFPA 13, Installation of Sprinkler Systems. A wet pipe sprinkler system provides a satisfactory level of protection with the least cost. The required design density is 0.50 gpm per ft2 under the fan deck. A sprinkler should also be provided over each fan motor. The area of application should be the hydraulically remote two cells. A hose demand of 500 gpm needs to be included in the calculations. Piping and fittings should preferably be of stainless steel materials or hot-dipped galvanized ASTM A153 steel. The piping should have a minimum UL corrosion resistance ratio of 1.0 and exposed pipe threads should be protected against corrosion.
Sprinkler water flow should shut down the fan motors. The provision of a manual fan interlock override switch is acceptable to reactivate the fan if it is determined that there is no fire. Water flow alarms and valve tamper signals should be connected to the existing fire alarm system. Plans and calculations should be submitted to Starr Tech for review and acceptance prior to commencement of the installation.
Comments: This recommendation remains open. BWP management stated that the sprinkler option was presented to the SCPPA ownership in 2015, but was rejected.

CHANGES
CHANGES SINCE PREVIOUS SURVEY
The following changes took place since Starr Tech’s last survey in 2018. The majority of these do not represent a significant fire or property loss prevention concern.
1. A new uninterruptable power supply (UPS) was provided in the colocation room.
2. A control oil actuator associated with the steam turbine was replaced. The original actuator had resulted in a significant oil leak at grade.
3. According to the detector manufacturer’s instructions (Fenwal), the heat detectors in the gas turbine compartments should not be tested with a heat gun or open flame, but with a specialized hot well testing apparatus. MPP has purchased a hot well and will be using this during the next annual testing cycle.

SITE DESCRIPTION
HISTORY
Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA) is a joint venture consisting of public utility agencies in Southern California comprising six cities: Anaheim, Burbank, Cerritos, Colton, Glendale and
Pasadena. SCPPA finances generation and transmission resources by leveraging the assets of its public power members. In 2000, Burbank proposed to SCPPA to develop an electric generating facility called the Magnolia Power Project (MPP). The main purpose of MPP is to offset transmission congestion. The largest share of MPP is owned by Anaheim (38%), then Burbank (31%), Glendale
(17%), Pasadena (6%) and Cerritos and Colton (4% each). SCPPA also has partial ownership in the
San Juan Generating plant in NM, Palo Verde station in AZ, and Canyon Power Project in Anaheim,
CA. SCPPA also has interests in several transmission lines and numerous renewable energy facilities.
This MPP site has been part of Burbank Water &amp; Power’s (BWP) electric generation facility since the
1930’s. Two older units were decommissioned and demolished during the early 2000s to make room for the Magnolia Power Project (MPP). The former turbine/control building was extensively remodeled and modified and became the new control/administration building for MPP. The plant was designed by Aker
Kvaerner. Construction was started in 2003 and the commercial operation started on September 22,
2005. MPP is stand-alone facility and is independent of BWP’s other three generating units onsite which consist of two older conventional steam units and a simple-cycle gas turbine unit.
As of this survey, the plant has accumulated approximately 90,000 total operating hours.
LAYOUT
MPP is located on BWP’s 23-acre site in downtown Burbank. MPP occupies approximately three acres in the northwest corner of the site.
Buildings associated with MPP include a three-story service/control building, the turbine building with the attached compressor building and two prefabricated detached electrical modules. The gas turbine and the boiler are located outdoors. The cooling tower is about 30 ft to the east of the turbine building.
The MPP assets, although not extremely congested, are spaced relatively close together due to the plant’s small footprint. Undesirable features include only 5 ft spatial separation distance between the control/administration building and the BWP warehouse, only 30 ft separation between the turbine building and the cooling tower and the lack of detachment for the gas compressor building. This was mitigated through a masonry fire wall between the gas compressor and the turbine buildings.
The reported location address of 164 W. Magnolia Blvd. is BWP’s headquarters building which is a separate building and not part of the MPP project. The actual address for MPP is 110 W. Magnolia
Blvd.

The main building is the service/control building at 110 W. Magnolia. This is a three-story building made primarily of reinforced concrete. Some of the concrete structure on the lower level is a remnant of the old turbine building that was partly demolished. The roof is a metal deck. There are no major floor-to- floor fire divisions.
The turbine building is of metal panel on unprotected steel frame construction. The ceiling is approximately 40 ft high. There are two substructures within the building. One is the poured concrete deck which supports the turbine-generator and the condenser. The other is the main electrical and battery room. This is a fire separate inside room of concrete block construction. The turbine building and the adjacent gas compressor building share a common inside wall of concrete block construction.
This wall provides a rated fire separation between the turbine and the compressor areas.
The three electrical modules are detached pre-assembled structures of light noncombustible construction. They are mounted on concrete piers approximately 4 ft above grade. The area beneath the modules is used for cable spreading.
There are no unusual or adverse construction features. All buildings appear to be in good condition and are well-maintained.
PHYSICAL EXPOSURES
The land is flat and the site is exposed to the north by a flood control channel and then an industrial building with approximately 100 ft spatial separation distance. To the east are two BWP cooling towers
(not associated with MPP) with approximately 75 ft spatial separation and the new BWP warehouse
(320 N. Lake – also not associated with MPP). To the south is the BWP headquarters building at 164
W. Magnolia (also not associated with MPP). To the west is a parking lot. Outside exposures are considered to be moderate.
NATURAL PERIL EXPOSURES
Earthquake: Seismic exposure is severe. In accordance with the Munich Re Natural Hazards
Assessment web site, the facility is in a Zone 4 (modified Mercalli scale of IX and above), defined as a probable maximum intensity with an exceedance probability of 10% in 50 years (equivalent to
'return period' of 475 years) for medium subsoil conditions.

EQUIPMENT AND SPECIAL HAZARDS
DESCRIPTION
This is a one-on-one combined-cycle electric generating plant. The plant is generally base-loaded, but the load depends on the owner cities’ load requirements. The plant load is scheduled on an hourly basis. The gross rating is 310 MW with a nominal output between 120 and 242 MW. The plant is operated and maintained by Burbank Water &amp; Power (BWP). MPP’s electrical output is transmitted to the BWP electrical grid. MPP’s ownership terminates at the main disconnect switches in the adjacent
69-kV BWP switchyard.
GAS COMPRESSORS
Two redundant gas compressors are provided. These are located in a building of light noncombustible construction attached to the turbine building. The common wall is made of concrete block. The building is further subdivided into two rooms that are subdivided by a metal wall, each containing a compressor.
Combustible gas detectors are reportedly interlocked to shutdown the affected compressor. Electrical equipment is suitable for Class I Division 2 hazardous locations. Fixed protection is provided by an automatic deluge sprinkler system actuated by flame detectors. The level of protection is adequate.
STEAM GENERATORS
The exhaust gasses from the gas turbine are routed into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The boiler has eight duct burners made by Forney. Combustion controls include double-block-and-bleed gas valves on each burner as well as flame failure and high/low gas pressure interlocks on the main piping manifold. There is a 15-minute programmed mandatory turbine purge prior to lightoff of the turbine. The duct burners have a separate purge permissive consisting of 90% turbine load plus five minutes. The level of protection appears to meet NFPA 85 and is adequate.
STEAM TURBINE GENERATOR
The steam turbine-generator is located in the turbine building. Refer to the appendix for equipment data. The turbine-generator is mounted on an elevated concrete platform with an open area beneath the turbine operating floor. The lube oil system consists of a reservoir located at the ground level in the turbine room and provided with a concrete secondary containment basin. The lube oil piping consists of welded and flanged steel pipe and contains no rubber expansion joints. The lube oil is a standard mineral oil. The hydrogen seal oil unit is located adjacent to the lube oil reservoir and is part of the lube oil system. The control oil system is separate of the lube oil system and uses Shell DR46, an FM-
Approved fire-resistive fluid. This system operates at 2,400 psi and has a volume of approximately 500 gal. Good drainage is provided. The turbine building floor is provided with drainage trenches around the turbine generator pedestal. There are no pits or depressions in the floor. Automatic sprinkler protection is provided throughout the building, including the ceiling, over the lube oil reservoir, over the bearings and under the operating deck. The level of protection is adequate.
A relatively small electric auxiliary boiler provides sealing steam for preheating the turbine during startup. It is located in the turbine building adjacent to the lube oil reservoir.

EQUIPMENT AND SPECIAL HAZARDS (Continued)
CONTROL &amp; CABLE SPREADING
The control room is located on the second floor of the service/control building. It only contains computer screens, but no computer hardware. Automatic sprinkler protection is provided. The plant control system is made by Delta V whereas the gas turbine controls use GE’s Mark 6 system.
There are four separate electrical rooms:
1. A detached electrical module containing switchgear related to the gas turbine (PEECC) is located outdoors adjacent to the turbine-generator. Fire protection is limited to smoke detection.
2. EB1 is a fire-separate inside room within the turbine building. It is of fire-resistive construction. It contains 4160 V electrical equipment related to the steam turbine. There is also a small room above the electrical room dedicated to the steam turbine control hardware. Fire protection comprises a fixed carbon dioxide (CO2) system for both spaces. The main generator breakers are located in the turbine room.
3. EB2 is a detached prefabricated module located adjacent to the turbine building. It contains balance-of-plant switchgear. Fire protection comprises a fixed carbon dioxide (CO2) system.
4. EB3 is also a detached module similar to EB2. Fire protection is limited to smoke detection.
No large concentrations of cables were noted. Cable trays in the turbine building and in the electrical rooms are stacked two and three trays high and are moderately loaded. The level of protection is adequate.
TRANSFORMERS
MPP comprises a total of seven outdoor oil-insulated transformers. Refer to the appendix for equipment data. There is a cluster of four transformers associated with the gas turbine and a cluster of three transformers associated with the steam turbine. Each cluster comprises a generator step-up transformer (GSU), an auxiliary transformer and one or two station service transformers. The clusters are separated by approximately 30 ft spatial separation distance. Each transformer is provided with an individual spill containment basin of apparently satisfactory capacity. Each transformer is provided with concrete fire walls. In addition, automatic deluge water spray protection is provided for each GSU and auxiliary transformer. Water spray is not provided for the smaller transformers. The level of protection is adequate.
COOLING TOWER
A six-cell cooling tower is located adjacent to the turbine building. It is made of fiber-reinforced plastic
(FRP) and comprises approximately 14,500 ft2. The fill is of PVC plastic. The cells are subdivided by fiberglass partition walls. FRP and PVC are combustible materials. The tower is not provided with sprinkler protection. Although many standard and optional tower components have low flame spread ratings below 25, the ASTM E-84 flame spread standard was intended for life safety purposes for materials installed in buildings and is not and was never intended to be used as a tool for evaluating the combustibility of a material or overall fire risk. Thus, without an actual fire risk test, it is impossible to ascertain whether a tower is subject to a fire loss potential unless it is made of entirely noncombustible materials. FM Global is the only laboratory that tests and approves complete towers and tower components. If the entire tower is Approved, it is accepted that the fire risk is too low to warrant automatic sprinkler protection. Conversely, if the tower is not Approved, sprinkler protection is considered necessary. The MPP purchase specifications called for an “FM-compliant” tower. Following the initial survey, plant management researched the tower and found that no FM-Approval was ultimately provided. A recommendation is submitted for either sprinkler protection or an evaluation of the tower components for fire risk. The loss of the cooling tower presents a much higher business interruption than property damage exposure.

EQUIPMENT AND SPECIAL HAZARDS (Continued)
Due to the lack of industry loss experience with fiberglass towers, the recommendation is submitted in the Advisory category. The level of protection is inadequate due to the severity of a fire loss, especially the loss of production.
GAS TURBINE-GENERATOR
This is a GE Frame 7+E (7241). It is located outdoors in a standard steel weather/noise enclosure. The enclosure consists of four separate compartments. The turbine compartment, the auxiliary compartment which contains the lube oil system, the hydraulic start-up system and the fuel valves, the load compartment which contains the shaft and inner generator bearing and the generator collector compartment which contains the outer generator bearing and exciter. The turbine and generator use a common lube oil system. Inlet air cooling is accomplished via an evaporative cooling system. The cooling medium is cellulose and was recently replaced. The generator is hydrogen-cooled. The lube oil reservoir is located within a detached metal enclosure and is provided with a concrete containment basin will be concrete sized to contain the reservoir volume plus rainwater.
Turbine combustion controls are in accordance with standard GE design. There are no known deficiencies for these units. According to Mr. Coman, the gas turbine fuel valves are provided with GE’s
“bottle test”. This consists of pressurizing the space within the double-block-and-bleed valves and monitoring the pressure with a pressure switch. This is automatically performed prior to each lightoff and constitutes a valve leakage test.
A total-flooding CO2 fire extinguishing system is provided for compartments with significant fire hazards.
There is no fire protection for the load compartment or the generator collector compartment. Smoke detection is provided inside the auxiliary control module. Combustible gas detection is also provided in the generator collector compartment.
The level of protection is adequate.
HYDROGEN
Both the steam turbine generator and the gas turbine generators are hydrogen-cooled. Each generator has a separate hydrogen system. The hydrogen supply consists of manifolded cylinders located outdoors under a metal roof with open sides just north of the cooling tower. Each hydrogen system is provided with low pressure alarms. Hydrogen pressure and consumption are tracked through daily inspections. The level of protection is in accordance with NFPA 55 and is adequate.
TANKAGE
Five fiberglass tanks are provided. All have nonflammable contents. These are used to store acid, condensate water, R.O. water, deminerlized water and cooling tower blow down water. They are of no further concern to this survey.
STORAGE AND WAREHOUSING
MPP does not comprise a storage facility. Rather, the spare parts inventory is kept at the adjacent BWP warehouse at 320 N. Lake which is adjacent to the service/control building. According to BWP management, this warehouse is not part of MPP. It is not listed on the statement of values either.
However, BWP management stated that approximately $23 million in inventory is maintained there for
MPP. The BWP warehouse is fully sprinkler-protected. A brief review revealed that high-piled storage areas have a generous 0.60/2500 density.

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
ORGANIZATION AND STAFFING
MMP is operated and maintained by BWP under contract. A staff of almost 40 BWP employees is dedicated to the three power plants on the premises. The staff includes 10 maintenance technicians, 20 operators, four instrument technicians and five electricians. Minimum plant staffing at any time is one shift supervisor, one control room operator and three plant operators. The BWP staff appears highly knowledgeable and competent. There is reportedly very little staff turnover.
INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY
Management: Most maintenance is performed by BWP staff. Some services are contracted to specialty contractors. MPP has a long-term service agreement with General Electric (GE) which lasts up to 96,000 equipment hours. A GE technical representative is onsite typically for a few days each week. Outages typically require the services of specialized contractors.
The service/control building comprises a well-equipped maintenance shop.
Electrical: A comprehensive thermographic (IR) inspection is performed on an annual basis.
Refer to the Starr Tech Boiler &amp; Machinery report for details. Transformer oil analysis is performed by a third party laboratory on an annual basis. Tests include dissolved gasses, sulfur and furan. A review of the latest reports from October 2018 showed that all gasses are normal in all transformers.
Metals: Refer to the Starr Tech boiler &amp; machinery report.
Vessels and Piping: Refer to the Starr Tech boiler &amp; machinery report.
Relief Valves: Refer to the Starr Tech boiler &amp; machinery report.
Rotating Equipment: Refer to the Starr Tech boiler &amp; machinery report.
Dismantle/Disassembly Schedule: Refer to the Starr Tech boiler &amp; machinery report.
SAFETY PROGRAMS
Hot Work: A formal BWP hot work program and procedure is implemented across all BWP facilities. The program is in writing. The hot work and confined space entry program are combined into one permit form and applies to all BWP staff and contractors. Permits are issued for each individual for one shift and require a fire watch. All completed permits are documented on the operations log. The hot work permit applies everywhere outside the maintenance shop. The hot work permit requires a mandatory fire watch during the hot work through 60 minutes following the completion. Closed hot work permits were reviewed during this visit.
Lock/Tag: A standard formal lock-out/tag-out program is in effect. A review of this program is outside the scope of this survey.

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS (Continued)
Operator Training and Procedures: Refer to the Starr Tech boiler &amp; machinery report.
Contractor Screening/Management: Contractors are screened by the City of Burbank. Prior to starting any work onsite, each individual must complete BWP’s contractor orientation and coordinate the work and necessary work permits with the control room operator.
Impairment Handling: A formal written fire protection equipment impairment procedure was generated and implemented in July 2013 as the result of a former Starr Tech recommendation. The procedure addresses routine short-term impairments for inspection purposes, as well as planned and unplanned impairments. It applies to BWP personnel and contractors and includes the use of an impairment tag and written logs. Impairment tags are also displayed in the control room as a reminder. The impairment log was reviewed during this visit.

PROTECTION
FIRE WATER SUPPLY
The fire water supply is from the municipal water system. The MPP site is served by two cross-tied connections. The primary supply consists of a 12-in fire service connection with a 10-in backflow preventer (Watts Model 709 DCDA) to a 12-in gridded municipal water main in Magnolia Blvd. This connection feeds a 12-in private underground fire protection loop around the plant (see the appendix for a diagram). The loop supplies sprinkler systems and eight wet-barrel aboveground fire hydrants.
Hydrants are spaced less than 250 ft, in accordance with good practices. The loop is provided with sectional valves. The secondary supply consists of a 12-inch connection with a backflow preventer to
BWP’s original 12-in potable water system which is served by separate connections to a gridded public water main in Lake and Olive streets.
The majority of BWP’s water is purchased from Metropolitan Water District (MWD). BWP also owns municipal wells. Treated domestic water is stored in tanks on a nearby mountain. This elevation head results in a relatively high system pressure of about 140 psi.
Based on the highest-demand sprinkler/water spray system (with the currently available data); the water supply can satisfactorily meet the required density, as shown in the water supply analysis in the appendix. The public water supply is reliable. Refer to the appendix for fire flow test data.
SPRINKLER AND FIXED PROTECTION
The MPP comprises eight hydraulically-designed automatic sprinkler systems. Refer to the appendix for design data. The design densities, where provided, are appropriate for the protected hazards. Below is a narrative description. Refer to the appendix for system design details.
Steam Turbine Building: The steam turbine building features three separate systems. A deluge system is provided over the lube oil reservoir. A separate deluge system is provided over the turbine and generator bearing assemblies as well the area directly under the turbine-generator under the operating floor. Both deluge systems are actuated by linear heat detection cable (Protectowire) routed along the sprinkler system feed and cross mains (spot heat detectors are provided over the bearings). A separate wet pipe system is provided at the ceiling of the entire building and under the mezzanine areas as well as under the condenser. This scheme results in all areas of the building with the exception of the electrical rooms being provided with sprinkler coverage.
There is one unusual feature. The oil hazards associated with the steam turbine-generator, including the turbine and generator bearings, are protected with an automatic deluge water spray system. Deluge protection results in the entire covered area being instantaneously flooded with water, regardless of where the fire originates. This method results in large quantities of water released over the equipment and into the building. The standard method of fire protection for steam turbine-generators in accordance with NFPA 850 consists of wet pipe sprinkler protection beneath the operating floor and a separate preaction water spray system protecting the bearing areas. The latter protection scheme provides better protection against an unwanted discharge than deluge protection and is therefore preferred in the industry. Deluge protection is acceptable for underwriting purposes.
Gas Compressors: The rooms are provided with an automatic deluge sprinkler system.
Transformers: Protection is provided for four outdoor transformers, including the gas turbine and the steam turbine generator step-up transformers and auxiliary transformers. The deluge systems are actuated by linear heat detection cable. The gas turbine transformers represent the highest system demand onsite.
Control Building: Wet pipe sprinkler protection is provided throughout the entire building. Each floor has a separate control valve. A preaction sprinkler system is provided for the two communications rooms.
Laboratory Building: Wet pipe sprinkler protection is provided throughout the entire building. There is one unusual feature. The sprinkler system is supplied from the domestic water system, rather than from the fire protection loop. This was acceptable per NFPA 13, 2013 edition.

PROTECTION (Continued)
Overall, the extent of sprinkler protection is very good and exceeds that which is typically provided at power generation plants. As such, protection is not considered necessary for the outdoor transformers, as they are provided with fire walls, nor for the gas compressor building, as it is of noncombustible construction with noncombustible occupancy.
Unprotected Areas: The cooling tower is not provided with automatic sprinkler protection. Refer to the Special Hazard discussion for details. Otherwise, there are no unprotected areas for which sprinkler protection would be necessary.
FOAM
No fixed foam systems or foam supplies are available onsite. Due to the nature of this facility, none are necessary.
SPECIAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
The facility comprises three automatic total-flooding carbon dioxide (CO2) fire extinguishing systems as follows:
Gas Turbine: The gas turbine is provided with a 6-ton low-pressure system, in accordance with the standard GE package and designed by Chemetron. The tank volume is sized for two full discharges.
This system has three zones which include the auxiliary compartment, the turbine compartment (and fuel valve compartment) and the exhaust tunnel are protected by CO2. There is an initial 1-minute discharge and a 40-minute extended discharge. The system is automatically actuated by cross-zoned heat detectors and combustible gas detectors. The design comprises a minimum concentration of 34% plus a temperature correction factor, per NFPA 12. There are no known deficiencies with the present design. A discharge/concentration test was performed June 2, 2005. A review of the acceptance test report concludes that the concentration in all three protected compartments significantly exceeded the minimum required 37% over a 30-minute duration.
EB1: The main electrical room located in the steam turbine building, as well as the small turbine instrumentation equipment room above, are provided with a total-flooding CO2 system. This system comprises a main discharge and an extended reserve. Each bank is provided with 1,900 lb net of agent.
The system is actuated by smoke detectors and reportedly incorporates a 20-second timed discharge delay.
EB2: The auxiliary electrical module located west of the steam turbine building is provided with a total- flooding CO2 system. This system is arranged similarly to that for EB1 above. Each bank is provided with 1,100 lb net of agent.
Notes:
1. Door fan tests were completed in 2015 for EB-1, the logic room and EB-2 by a local contractor, Jam
Fire Protection, with satisfactory results. At the minimum required concentration of 34% by NFPA
12, the calculated retention times were 13 minutes for EB-1 ground level, 12 minutes for EB-1 upstairs, and 11 minutes for EB-2. This is acceptable to Starr Tech in lieu of actual concentration testing.

PROTECTION (Continued)
2. Although not prohibited by NFPA 12, CO2 is not a preferred fire suppression agent for normally occupied spaces, such as electrical rooms, due to its lethal properties. SCPPA is encouraged to apply all standard and necessary retroactive personnel safeguards required by NFPA 12 to preclude a discharge when the spaces are occupied.
The colocation and telecommunications rooms are both provided with separate automatic total- flooding NOVEC 1230 gaseous clean agent fire extinguishing systems. Both systems passed a door fan test for a 10-minute retention time following their installation. The colocation room system comprises 236 lb of agent and the telecommunications room comprises 100 lb of agent.
Combustible gas detectors are provided within the gas turbine enclosure and at the ceiling of the gas compressor building. Actuation of the detectors will reportedly shut the affected equipment down automatically. Two override key switches are provided for the fuel gas compressor valves. The switches inhibit the automatic closure of the valves in the event of a fire alarm system or gas detection system actuation. The switches are used only when work is performed in the gas compressor room to prevent unwanted tripping of the gas valves. Such inadvertent trips have reportedly occurred in the past and result in unwanted plant outages.
FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS
Two separate addressable fire alarm systems with battery backup power are provided. One system serves the control building. It includes sprinkler water flow, smoke detection and manual pull stations. A second fire alarm system serves the steam turbine building. Both fire alarm control panels are located in the control building.
Each of the two main fire alarm panels also features remote annunciation panels located in the service/administration building lobby as well as the constantly staffed control room. All fire alarms are also transmitted offsite to a UL-listed Central Station alarm monitoring company, National FailSafe. The fire alarm system is satisfactory and appears to be designed and installed in accordance with NFPA 72.
The EB-3 electrical module is provided with a separate fire alarm panel. This panel is connected to the steam turbine alarm system.
Each CO2 system is provided with its own listed release panel. The release panels are connected to the corresponding building fire alarm panels. The CO2 system for the gas turbine is connected to the Mark
6 turbine control system.
Fire protection valves are provided with electronic supervision (valve tamper switches).
TESTING, INSPECTION &amp; MAINTENANCE
A formal inspection, testing and maintenance (ITM) program is in effect for fire protection equipment.
Most tasks are contracted out to an outside contractor, Facilities Protection Systems. The following is a summary of current activities:
? Weekly visual inspections of all fire protection control valves by plant personnel.
? Monthly visual inspections of fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems and fire protection valves by plant personnel.
? Quarterly visual sprinkler system inspections and water flow alarm testing.
? Semiannual level checks of high-pressure CO2 and clean agent cylinders. Only one weighing was performed in 2018 as the contractor missed the second weighing.
? Semiannual testing of the clean agent extinguishing systems.

PROTECTION (Continued)
? Semiannual testing and calibration of combustible gas detectors plant personnel.
? Annual inspection and testing of CO2 systems.
? Annual testing of fire alarm systems.
? Annual sprinkler system testing, including partial trip-testing of deluge systems.
? Five-year testing/replacement of high-pressure CO2 hoses with the last replacement in 2013.
? Five-year sprinkler system state certification completed in 2016.
? Hydrostatic testing of high-pressure CO2 cylinders completed in 2016/2017.
These frequencies are generally in accordance with applicable NFPA standards, including NFPA 12 and NFPA 25.
Due to the many reports generated by the contractor over the period of a year, ensuring that all necessary reports are on file with BWP is a tedious task that needs to be performed by an individual who has a working knowledge of fire protection systems ITM standards, other than the contractor. This individual also needs the authority to correct deficiencies. The writer provided a customized matrix which is used to facilitate this task. This one-page table summarizes all of the necessary tasks, their completion dates and any comments. The contractor’s inspection reports for 2018 were reviewed during this visit and checked against the matrix table.
PASSIVE PROTECTION
Several passive fire protection features are provided, as follows:
Control Building: Each floor of the control building appears to have a one-hour fire separation.
Steam Turbine Building: The main electrical room and the turbine instrumentation equipment room located above it are of fire-resistive concrete block construction with what appears to be a two-hour division.
Gas Compressor: The gas compressor building is attached to the turbine building. The common wall between the compressor room and the turbine room is made of fire-resistive concrete block construction.
PUBLIC FIRE DEPARTMENT
Public response is from the full-time paid Burbank municipal fire department. The department operates six stations with 130 career personnel. The nearest station (#11) is approximately one mile from the plant. The community has achieved an ISO Class 1 rating as of 1/1/2017.
MUTUAL AID
Recognized automatic aid response is provided to the entire graded area by the Glendale municipal fire department.
EMERGENCY ORGANIZATION &amp; PREPAREDNESS
A formal written emergency action plan is in effect. It is part of the Illness &amp; Injury Prevention program.
The plan addresses actions to be taken in the event of emergencies and natural disasters. A wheeled
200-lb CO2 extinguishing cart is located on the ground floor of the steam turbine building.

UTILITIES
FUEL
The only fuel is natural gas. The fuel is delivered by the local utility, Southern California Gas Company from their transmission and distribution system. There is a metering station adjacent to MPP on Olive
St. Fuel is supplied by the utility at 225 psi. Two redundant gas compressors boost the pressure to approximately 450 psi. There is no history of natural gas interruptions.
ELECTRICITY
Electric power is generated at 13.8kV and stepped up to 69 kV by two separate generator step-up transformers. The power is transferred to the BWP grid in the adjacent switchyard. Parasitic power is stepped down from 13.8 kV to 4160 V and 480 V. MPP does not have black start capability. However, black-start capability is provided by the Lake One gas turbine plant (not part of SCPPA). The BWP electrical grid must be energized to start MPP.
AIR &amp; INERT GASSES
Compressed plant air is provided from several redundant industrial air compressors. There is no use of other industrial gasses other than small cylinders with test gasses for emissions monitoring.
PROCESS WATER
The facility does not use municipal water. All process water is obtained as effluent from the City of
Burbank sewage treatment plant which his located approximately 1,500 ft to the north of MPP. An onsite reverse osmosis plant makes demineralized water for use in the boiler.
WASTE WATER
This is a zero-discharge facility, meaning that no waste water is discharged to the municipal sewage system with the exception of rainwater runoff. Cooling tower blow-down water is treated and recycled.
The solids from the water treatment are disposed in a landfill.

VALUATION DISCUSSION
The above values were retrieved from the 2018//2019 Statement of Values (SOV). The values have increased slightly from 2018. They appear to be reasonable. Reported values for key equipment are as follows:
Service/control building: $31.9M
Steam turbine-generator: $118M
Gas turbine-generator: $113M
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DISCUSSION
The business interruption potential is moderate. The gas turbine-generator and the steam turbine- generator each affect 100% of power production. MPP comprises two generating units, but the steam turbine depends on thermal energy generated by the gas turbine. Although the plant reportedly has the ability to run in simple cycle mode by condensing all of the steam generated (the condenser was sized for this), this would significantly reduce the plant’s heat rate and may require obtaining an operating permit variance.
Bottlenecks include the two GSU transformers. There no spares. A good transformer testing program is in place.
The current air quality permit allows three starts per month.
MPP’s owners are responsible for the fuel costs. Since the incoming fuel pressure is less than the required pressure, the gas compressor is essential.
The majority of the electric power is used by the member utilities. MPP supplies the power to the member utilities at cost after deducting expenses. With the exception of Burbank which takes the power directly on the BWP grid, the power is wheeled by other utilities. Any excess power is sold on the open market at the prevailing spot prices.
The environmental permit limits the number of starts to five per month.
